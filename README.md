# Validation Form ✨

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple form validation project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It's part of my learning journey in web development.

The form checks if all inputs are correctly filled before submission — like email, name, password, etc.  
If anything's missing or incorrect, it shows an error message.

## What I used:
- HTML for structure 🏗  
- CSS for styling 🎨  
- JavaScript for form validation logic 🧠

## What I learned:
- How to handle form inputs
- Writing JavaScript functions for real-time validation
- Giving a better user experience with error messages

## How to try it:
Just open the index.html file in your browser and test it out!
